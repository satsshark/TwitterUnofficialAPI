# TwitterUnofficialAPI

Twitter's internal API (unofficial). This module contains Twitter's unofficial APIs, which include both the web front-end APIs and the Android app APIs. It has been developed through reverse engineering of the Twitter app and web front-end. This module is utilized by multiple Twitter bots owned by me, such as  [@LmaoGPT](https://twitter.com/LmaoGPT), 
[@Babydogeburn_](https://twitter.com/Babydogeburn_), [@TruthGPTBot](https://twitter.com/TruthGPTBot), [@ShadowbanBot_](https://twitter.com/ShadowbanBot_), [@Briseburn](https://twitter.com/briseburn) and many more..

The script is well-structured, properly maintained, and comes with sample files and readme documentation.
