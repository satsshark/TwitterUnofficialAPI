# TwitterUnofficialAPI
Twitter's internal API (unofficial). The module is written in python and is being used by multiple twitter bots owned by me. Comes with many additional benefits compare to the official twitter APIs such as up-to 6000 tweets per day, supports Note tweets, Scheduling tweets, direct message streaming, New followers streaming.
